Bulls and Cows is a 2 player game. One player thinks of a number, while the other player tries to guess it.

For every guess that the player makes, he gets 2 values - the number of bulls and the number of cows.
1 bull means the guess and the target number have 1 digit in common, and in the correct position.
1 cow means the guess and the target have 1 digit in common, but not in correct position.
